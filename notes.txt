Whatâ€™s Missing?
If you aim for professional PHP development or more advanced features, you may need to explore:

Object-Oriented PHP (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, etc.
Frameworks: Laravel, Symfony, or CodeIgniter for modern PHP development.
API Development: Building RESTful APIs with PHP.
File Handling: Reading/writing files, file uploads.
Testing: PHPUnit for testing PHP code.
Advanced Security: CSRF, SQL injection prevention, and using prepared statements


// note
there are two ways to connect over the my sql database 
1: mysqli extension
2: PDO(php data objects)- this is where the oops is needed
